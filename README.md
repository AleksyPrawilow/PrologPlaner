# PrologPlaner
## Why does this project exist?
The project's aim was to teach us how and when to use different programming paradigms. 
## How does it work?
At the beginning the user is asked to input basic information about the day: when do the classes begin, end, how long should each class last and how long should the recess be. After that the user is prompted to input all the teachers and their subjects. The program then sends this data to prolog, which generates all possible combinations of the schedules based on the info provided. Finally, the result is displayed.
